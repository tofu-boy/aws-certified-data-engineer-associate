# Data Engineering Fundementals

## Types of Data
### Structured
Data that is organised in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relation databases.
 - Easily Queryable
 - Organized in rows and columns
 - Has a consistent structure


### Unstructured
Data that does not have a predefined structure or schema.
 - Not easily queryable without preprocessing
 - May come in various formats

Examples

 - Text files without a fixed format
 - Videos and audio files
 - Images
 - Emails and word processing documents


### Semi-structured
Data that is not as organised as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, heirarchies or other patterns. 
 - Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way
 - More flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data

Examples
 - Log files with varied formats
 - XML and Json
 - Email headers

## Properties of Data
### Volume
Amount or size of data that organisations are dealing with at any given time.

### Velocity
Refers to the speed at which new data is generated, collected and processed.
High velocity required real-time or near-real-time processing capabilities.
Rapid ingestion and processing can be critical for certain applications.

Sensor data from IoT.

High-frequency trading systems where milliseconds can make a difference in decision-making.


### Variety
Refers to the different types, structures and sources of the data. 

Maybe we have a business analysing data from emails, json logs and databases.
